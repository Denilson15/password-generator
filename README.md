# Password Generator

This is a custom-built password generator developed from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. While the project idea was inspired by Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Path, the entire design and codebase were independently created to practice building interactive web applications and managing user input.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.

## ✨ Overview

Live Demo: [https://splendorous-jelly-eb1de1.netlify.app/](https://splendorous-jelly-eb1de1.netlify.app/)

This project showcases a functional password generator that allows users to create secure passwords based on selected criteria. It includes:

- Options to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
- A slider to select the desired password length
- A button to generate a new password
- A feature to copy the generated password to the clipboard

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Users select the desired character types and password length.
- JavaScript captures the input and generates a random password based on the selected criteria.
- The generated password is displayed on the screen.
- A copy button allows users to copy the password to their clipboard for easy use.

## 🛠️ Personalization

Although the initial concept was provided by Scrimba, the following customizations were implemented:

- Designed and styled the layout from scratch using CSS
- Implemented password generation logic in JavaScript
- Ensured responsiveness across various screen sizes

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Add strength indicator to show password security level
- Implement dark mode for better user experience
- Enhance the user interface with improved styling and animations

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)

- `index.html` – Main structure of the webpage
- `index.css` – Styling for layout and design
- `index.js` – JavaScript for handling user input and password generation
- `vite.config.js` – Configuration for Vite

## ⚙️ Getting Started
